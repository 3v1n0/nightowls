# About flow

The experience of flow is different for every programmer, the little rituals and routines for making the magic happen even more so. Despite this, there are three phases of flow that follow a common pattern - understanding what they are is a good start to realizing why programmers often work at night.

## Falling into flow

### Habit

Many programmers start coding when they are very young. There are few other professions where people start dabbling before leaving grade school and yet, many such programmers exist. It seems almost everybody who is very good started before finishing high school.

I don't know why [find out?], but this has an effect on our work habits later in life.

When a programmer is still in school, they don't really have time to code during the day - it's just a hobby, there's more important things to tend to, like schoolwork - and they come to associate coding with the night.

Therefore, coding at night just feels more natural. You wouldn't code before 3pm no more than you would drink hard liquor before 3pm. It just doesn't feel right.

### Shifting sleep schedules

Of course you _could_ code before 3pm, a lot of people do. You likely wouldn't lose a bet saying most employed programmers spend a lot of time at work before 3pm.

But without an external schedule coding at night just feels more natural. It's when the fun stuff happens.

You still need to sleep, though. What happens when you go to bed at two in the morning? You wake up at ten in the morning, perhaps nine. If you're really hardcore even at eight.

Come evening, you don't feel sleepy until midnight. You're just working on something interesting, so you keep working until 1am. Or slightly later.

Eventually your sleep cycle shifts into a different timezone because you keep goign to bed later and later, because you've woken up much later and so on ad infinitum until your alarm clock and society pressure put you in an equilibrium of sorts.

For a lot of people that equilibrium seems to be waking up at 11am and going to bed at 3am. I don't know why.

## Staying in flow

### Bright screens

One of the biggest factors in human sleep-wake cycle is natural lgiht. Scientists have shown that without external stimuli we would all be living on a roughly 26 hour cycle, but there are systems in our bodies that help us sync with the sun.

This is very important because days aren't equally long and before artificial lighting it wouldn't be very useful to stay awake for the same time in winter days as in summer days. Doesn't make sense and you need to conserve energy when it's cold anyway.

Modern lighting plays foul with those principles. Computer screens especially.

This is because the light coming off our screens is very white, aimed right at our eyes and usually insanely bright because monitors are set to stupid brightness levels by default and most people forget to changesdfsdf those.

All of this just plays back into the not-becoming-sleepy problem and keeps us up longer. Because we aren't sleepy, we might as well work huh?
