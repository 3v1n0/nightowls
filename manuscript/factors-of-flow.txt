# About flow

Flow is arguably the most important concept in a programmer's life, we need it to work effectively, to cope with the sheer complexity of the systems we are dealing with. A large part of our work lives revolves around effectively and as frequently as possible getting into flow.

But flow is a fragile balance between many opposing forces. The programmer must be willing and able to completely focus on the task at hand, they must have a clear goal to work towards, fresh challenges must be coming in just quickly enough and they must feel a sense of purpose, even joy, in whatever they do.

## The autotelic personality

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi - the father of flow research in psychology - in his work describes a type of personality that can experience episodes of flow more easily and more often than most people. Because of difficulties involved in reproducing flow at will not much research has been made on this concept, but initial findings _do_ show some people achieve flow more easily than others.

People with an autotelic personality are said to be:

 * curious
 * persistent
 * not self-centered
 * often perform activities for intrinsic reasons

It is said that when a normal person pushes a big button saying "Don't press this" and gets electrocuted, they think to themselves "Heh, I shouldn't have done that." But when an engineer presses that same button they go "Huh, I wonder if that happens every time"

All programmers are engineers at heart, no matter what their formal qualifications say. 

Relentlessly hunting down bugs is a source of great pride for most programmers and many would sooner go without sleep than allow a bug to remain in production code. More experienced developers will often go to sleep once they realise they've started making silly mistakes, but they will never forget a bug that's taunting them.

Even a casual perusal of Github repositories will show that a lot of programmers indulge in so called pet projects - little programs developed for the fun of it, to sharpen the saw if you will. Interestingly enough, flow is much easier to experience on pet projects than large for-money behemoths.

It could be argued that programmers are very selfless people - the existence of communities like StackOverflow, large numbers of conferences where speakers share their knowledge for free, numerous blogs and free tutorials, not to mention the large opensource community that's given us something as powerful as the linux operating system and the stack most of the internet runs on. All of those are done hollistically ... well, mostly. Everybody gains from having a good standing in the community.

As a group of people, programmers exhibit all the traits of an autotelic personality. This would suggest flow is much more pervalent amongst programmers than in other groups of people, which might also explain why we programmers are often perceived as night walkers.

## Is achieving flow easier at night?

Yes, flow is indeed much easier to achieve in the evening. At least for those of us who manage to think clearly and still feel relatively rested. For many, this is impossible due to how their work lives are structured.

### Decision fatigue

The biggest enemy to evening and night-time productivity is decision fatigue. Most people experiencing decision fatigue don't really recognise it for what it is, but if you've ever felt well rested physically and still couldn't think clearly, like your brain was tired, you've experienced decision fatigue.

Research [which] has shown that humans can only accept a limited amount of decisions every day, after that we no longer think things through but usually just go with the default action. Every little decision factors into your daily quota - everything from deciding what to eat for breakfast, to which outfit to wear and what websites to read now or later.

This is why the checkout aisle in your supermarket is filled with tiny things you otherwise wouldn't have bought and why people instinctively want to "sleep on it" when making big decisions.

Depending on how a programmer's day is structured, working in the evening can be a godsend or a spaghetti code mess producing mistake.

## Falling into flow

### Habit

Many programmers start coding when they are very young. There are few other professions where people start dabbling before leaving grade school and yet, many such programmers exist. It seems almost everybody who is very good started before finishing high school.

I don't know why [find out?], but this has an effect on our work habits later in life.

When a programmer is still in school, they don't really have time to code during the day - it's just a hobby, there's more important things to tend to, like schoolwork - and they come to associate coding with the night.

Therefore, coding at night just feels more natural. You wouldn't code before 3pm no more than you would drink hard liquor before 3pm. It just doesn't feel right.

### Shifting sleep schedules

Of course you _could_ code before 3pm, a lot of people do. You likely wouldn't lose a bet saying most employed programmers spend a lot of time at work before 3pm.

But without an external schedule coding at night just feels more natural. It's when the fun stuff happens.

You still need to sleep, though. What happens when you go to bed at two in the morning? You wake up at ten in the morning, perhaps nine. If you're really hardcore even at eight.

Come evening, you don't feel sleepy until midnight. You're just working on something interesting, so you keep working until 1am. Or slightly later.

Eventually your sleep cycle shifts into a different timezone because you keep goign to bed later and later, because you've woken up much later and so on ad infinitum until your alarm clock and society pressure put you in an equilibrium of sorts.

For a lot of people that equilibrium seems to be waking up at 11am and going to bed at 3am. I don't know why.

## Staying in flow

### Bright screens

One of the biggest factors in human sleep-wake cycle is natural lgiht. Scientists have shown that without external stimuli we would all be living on a roughly 26 hour cycle, but there are systems in our bodies that help us sync with the sun.

This is very important because days aren't equally long and before artificial lighting it wouldn't be very useful to stay awake for the same time in winter days as in summer days. Doesn't make sense and you need to conserve energy when it's cold anyway.

Modern lighting plays foul with those principles. Computer screens especially.

This is because the light coming off our screens is very white, aimed right at our eyes and usually insanely bright because monitors are set to stupid brightness levels by default and most people forget to changesdfsdf those.

All of this just plays back into the not-becoming-sleepy problem and keeps us up longer. Because we aren't sleepy, we might as well work huh?
