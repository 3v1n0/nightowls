# Introduction

Hello, I am Book. 

Now that we're not strangers anymore even your mother would agree you can talk to me!

## Why should you read this book?

Because Swizec, the guy writing Book will be very happy if you do.

More importantly, it will let you in on the inner workings of programmers, those strange people making your modern life possible. The guys creating your internet, the lasses who make credit card systems, those people making sure opposing streets on a crossroads don't get green lights at the same time. Not to even mention the heroes making sure airplanes don't fall out of the sky and your airbags deploy on time.

If there's a part of your life that programmers have yet to touch, I bet somebody in a research lab somewhere (probably Japan) is trying to change that as we speak.

Wouldn't it be marvelous to find out more about programmers?

## Whom Book is for

Book is for programmers and the people who have to deal with programmers' strange habits all the time.

Wives, girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, managers, sons, daughters ...  if there's a programmer in your life, you should read Book, it will make your life much easier and the programmer will like you all the more for understanding them.

If you're a programmer, the last part of Book is for you.

## What Book contains

There are four sections to Book.

First we'll explore whether programmers do in fact work at night or that's more of a myth than not.

Then we'll see some reasons about why they work at night to help everyone understand what's going on.

The last two sections are of a more practical nature, with the first being a bunch of tips for dealing with programmers and the second being full of tips for programmers on how to handle their habits to better integrate with the rest of society.

## What is not in Book

Book is not hard science. It's a collection of opinions weighed by conversations with other programmers online and off, reading some reasearch about sleep and so on. If you want to look at hard science on the subject, you should talk to some of the wonderful sleep scientists.

I don't know this yet. I really don't.

But the section should be funny.

## Why Swizec wrote Book and why you should listen to him

Swizec would like to think he's someone you should listen to when it comes to prattling on and on about programmers.

Maybe he's not, that's up to you.

He _has_ been a programmer for the past fifteen years, which is something not everybody can say at 25. MOst of this time has been spent working either at night or all the time.

People have been paying him as a computer whisperer for almost ten years. His first paid writing gig started a year ago.

His age puts him just beyond the "I know everything" stage in life and makes him think he's an old sage who's supposed to give everyone advice on how to live their lives.

Really though, he hangs out with a lot of programmers, got a few of them (both younger and older) to let him pick their brain and the last time he wrote about this topic he got a bunch of women thanking him for letting them understand their male humans.

No female programmer has ever written him an email before. He is starting to think there _are_ no female programers because they all have beards just like the other dwarvesprogrammers.
