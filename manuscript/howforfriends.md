# For people around programmers

Having programmers in your life can be challenging. They're a strange bunch, keeping odd hours, saying jokes you don't understand, speaking what can seem a foreign language â€¦ Often not approachable to the uninitiated, they are almost as likely to solve your problem as they are to laugh that you're a "luser" (comically unskilled computer user).

Don't let this external display of stellar egos and terrible people skills scare you away, programmers are a friendly bunch, perhaps the most accepting group of people I've ever met. Most of their faults stem from a male dominated culture with a large portion of highly intelligent people. Elitism, exclusivism and plain old "being a brat" naturally follow.

If there's one thing you need to know about programmers, it's that they like to be terse. Hanging out with computers all day, putting elegance on the highest pedestal and being deep in thought means they generally like to waste as few words as possible to make a point.

Many take this as rudeness.

At the same time, programmers are very accepting of just about anyone. Show a little interest in their craft and programmers will accept you as their own even if you're a purple-skinned lesbian sea monster.

## Working with programmers

The greatest challenge of working with programmers is having two people working closely together on a single project. Probably sitting close by they are the best source of interruption for each other.

Imagine you are one of the two. Getting up to grab some coffee, do you ask the other person if they want some as well? When hitting a snag, do you ask them a question immediately or wait until a good moment? Noticing a magnificently hilarious cat picture, do you tell them? Share it immediately or send an email, or keep it to yourself?

The answer to these questions will define how great you are to work with.

### How interruptions spread 

There is a team of programmers working together in an office. Deep in thought, code effortlessly flowing from their fingertips, one of them suddenly hits a snag. It happens because a related piece of code designed by another programmer is behaving in unexpected ways. 

Unable to resolve the issue themselves they are violently thrown out of flow. Snapped back into reality our programmer looks around the office in dazed confusion. Will somebody notice their plight? Will somebody volunteer a helping _"What's the problem? Can I help?"_, or is everyone too deep in their own mess to notice?

One of two things is going to happen next.

1. Nothing else to work on, no desire for some creative procrastination, the developer musters the courage to ask a question _now_. They walk up to the person they reckon could help and ask them a question. Now both developers are out of flow.

2. The other likely possibility isn't much better. The developer first arses about on the internet for a while, hoping this will jog their brain and produce a bit of inspiration. It doesn't work. They get up for a walk - somewhere deep in the recesses of their mind a small voice is saying they need to stretch their legs. Another developer notices activity out of the corner of their eye and decides it's time for a break. Now both developers are out of flow.

There are infinite variations on these two courses of events, but they all result in the same thing. Two interrupted developers who will take half an hour at least to get back in flow.

But now the interruption is gaining momentum. It will spread person to person until everyone in the office is out of flow. As the group becomes louder and more chaotic so its interruptive potential grows. Each new member also adds another connective point for interrupting somebody else.

Of course there is also a dampening effect so the smaller and more personally connected the team, the likelier it is all of it will be affected by an interruption.

These events are inevitable, what's important is how far they are allowed to spread and whether they are productive in solving the problem that started them. A certain number of productive interruptions is healthy, even necessary, too many can kill everyone's productivity.
