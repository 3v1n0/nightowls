# Why programmers work at night

There's a magic in the night-time. The peace and quiet, the internal serenity … There's just you, your work and an infinite abundance of time. You are alone.

As a society we know that smart, talented people work at night. Usually alone, they solve problems mere mortals could only dream of. Look no further than your nearest book, movie or TV show about a lone genius.

He is a youngish man. A bit of a loner. Doesn't get along with people terribly well. Works at night or before dawn.

The stereotypical programmer is no different - he writes mean things on the internet, likes staying up late, lives off coffee and energy drinks.

While other parts of the stereotype are a very personal matter, there is a growing body of research supporting the stereotype that intelligent and creative people are more likely to lead a nocturnal lifestyle.

[A study published in 2006](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886999000549) discovered a correlation between night owl behaviour and high IQ. One possible explanation from evolutionary psychology is that intelligent people are more likely to seek novelty and because humans were always daytime creatures, there was novelty in being nocturnal.

Another study [find link] has also found that while people are more productive in the morning - more able to carry out tasks - they are more creative in the evening, more capable of finding novel solutions to existing problems.

Being more creative when you are slightly tired makes sense. Decision fatigue, like alcohol, lowers your reservations against trying new things, which can lead to novel solutions. But it can also lead to terrible ideas.

> To do high, real good physics work you do need absolutely solid lengths of time, so that when you’re putting ideas together which are vague and hard to remember /../ it needs a lot of concentration

  ~ Richard Feynman, The Pleasure of Finding Things Out

Just like Feynman's physics example, programming is a process requiring deep thought and a lot of concentration. It's abstractions all the way down. Literally, there is not a single solid thing to grab onto when you are programming.

Unless you're writing software for robots. That can be rather tangible.






For creativ. Look no further than your nearest book, movie or TV show about a lone genius and you'll see creative people are _expected_ to work at night. Nobody finds it odd.

If you're talented, smart and motivated you're supposed to work at night.

But stereotypes exist for a reason, especially ones so pervasive most don't even think of them as stereotypes anymore. It's important to ask ourselves _why_ are creative people expected to work at night or so early in the morning that it might well be night.

 It makes sense people would pick up on this and start assuming that smart people work at night. Add a sprinkling of broad generalisations and a few decades, even centuries, of folklore and voila "Smart and creative people work at night".

Even the best of correlations tells us nothing about reasons, however, so let's dig deeper.







The gist of the matter can be explained in two words

 * flow
 * culture

Cultural expectations can be said to derive from the concept of flow.

## Flow

Before I can explain why a programmer will howl at you like a wolfman out of a 1950's B horror movie when you step into their cave unannounced, it is important you understand the concept of flow.

> Flow is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

Discovered in the 1950's [fact check] by [guy who did] when he was observing artists, especially painters, who would get so lost in their work they could forget to eat, drink and lose track of time to the point of forgetting what day it is.

Flow is the natural state of the programmer.

Any programmer will tell you stories of the wonderful work they've done while in the flow, in the zone, wired in or any of a number of euphemisms that all mean the same thing - the programmer had an interesting task, it was challenging, but not too much, and they were left alone to work.

A lot, if not most, of creative professions experience flow, but it's especially important for programmers. Our work is very complex, the systems we work on have become so complex they are impossible for an individual to understand.

When a programmer works, they are usually fully immersed in the work, are keeping an intricate system of variables, functions and libraries in their head and a single interruption can bring it all tumbling down.

More importanly, our work provides everything that's necessary to achieve flow:

 * challenging
 * offers immediate feedback
 * clear objectives
 * never really ends

It's very easy to get sucked into a programming task. You build up the framework in your mind, start working, constantly recieve feedback from your computer, make tweaks, beat one small problem after another until suddenly it's morning and birds are chirping outside your window.

If you've ever experienced flow, you are nodding in understanding. If not, you think I'm crazy and are talking complete nonsense.

But surely you've played a video game before? Those are specifically designed to put players in a state of flow with a never-ending list of challenges, each more difficult than the previous. Just enough to keep you interested, not enough to make you give up.

Now imagine your job looked like that. A string of problems, each just difficult enough to keep you fully engaged.


## Cultural expectations

As a culture we romanticise burning the midnight oil. Nothing tickles our imagination and pride as human beings more than people working hard through the night only to emerge with a solution to a difficult problem in the morning.

We romanticise it. Cherish it. Equate it with genius and talent.

Sherlock Holmes stays up all night in a mad frenzy when he's working on a case, John Nash doesn't even realize it's already morning in A Beautiful Mind, young Zuckerberg builds the whole face match website [look up actual site] in a single night fueled by alcohol and heartbreak ... The list goes on and on.

We love a good hero.

And what better hero can there be than a lone genius who single-handedly solved the mystery while everyone else was sleeping?

We love the obsession. The devotion. The madness of it all. We want to be just like those fictional characters. Sacrificing everything just to come up with an answer.

The reality behind all the romantics is simply that these are individuals who fell into a state of flow and likely didn't even notice they had worked through the night. We think they are geniuses, but research [what research] has shown that flow is much more frequent for highly skilled individuals working on highly challenging tasks.

There's just one problem with all this romanticising - cargo cultism.

As programmers, we _know_ geniuses in books and movies always work in the night and emerge victorious. This makes us very proud of working at night. Very _very_ proud.

No small amount of male (and female?) bravado is associated with bragging about how little sleep we need, how we stayed up all night to fix this or that bug, how we saved the day by fixing production all night only to be ready for launch day in the morning.

Launch was an incredible success of course.

But what of the code? The servers? Somebody else will worry about that. Later. Right now we're high on sleep deprivation and success.
