# Do programmers work at night?

Before we can really tackle anything in this book, it is vital to understand whether programmers work at night or this is just some strange myth perpetuated by the romantic view of a hacker in the night-time creating marvelous things, unleashing them upon the world and magically coming up with the next Facebook.

I asked a few programmers whether they worked at night.

The short answer was: Yes.

A long answer involves a lot of things, so really, it depends.

## It depends

Programmers in general do seem to work at night, just take a moment too look around the internet and ask some people. You'll notice a lot of advice on stimulants, plenty of romanticizing about late nights and a lot of bravado about how little sleep people need.

But talk to individual programmers and you might discover a different picture - a lot of people saying they mostly work during the day, at worst the afternoon. A lot of people feeling terrible about wanting to work at night, admiting they mostly do it to chase deadlines and so on ...

Most importantly, it depends a lot on the age of the person you are talking to. Not because age has that much to do with it, although I'll talk about the effect of age on sleep cycles later in the book, but because age is a good indicator of the kind of lifestyle programmers lead ... for reasons a good sociologist can explain.

The main factors seem to be:

 * freelancer or staffer?
 * student of some sort?
 * have pet projects?
 * spouse and/or children?

### Types of programmers

You can put programmers into roughly two groups - those who are freelancers and those who are employed at an organisation.

A grey area exists with programmers who run their own larger businesses, but they seem to mostly follow the pattern of staffers because they've got staffers of their own to manage.

The two groups of programmers exhibit different work patterns. Those who are employed are more likely to work during the day because their schedule demands it. Either they have to be available on skype during office hours, if they work from home, or their physical presence is required in the office.

This is mostly due to collaboration with their colleagues. It's difficult to collaborate when somebody only answers their emails at 3am on a full moon and somebody else is stuck on a bug at 10am on a Wednesday.

On the other hand you have freelancers and people generally working without an external schedule.

They seem more likely to work in the evenings and at night, but strangely often this is not due to preference about when they feel more productive, but because of guilt. For one reason or another they can't seem to get "enough" done, for varying definitions of enough, during the day so they are left having to work at night.

Interestingly enough, freelancers also tend to work on much tighter self-imposed deadlines and then have to chase deadlines at the last minute when they sudenly can't meet their expectations or something goes wrong and throws off their schedule.

### Age of programmers

Research into circadian rhythms [citation needed] has shown that people's sleep pereferences change as they age. We start off as morning larks who want to wake up at 6am or earlier and become drowsy fairly early in the evening.

But as we grow older our cycle shifts and hits the nocturnal peak around 21 years of age where we prefer to wake up at 10am or thereabouts and go to bed much laster than midnight.

Unsurprisingly, teenagers and college students are known for sleeping in every day and avoiding any mental activity before noon.

After that our cycle starts shifting back into its "natural" state and by the time we reach our 65th birthday we are once more complete morning larks with our preferred wake up time around 6am.

When was the last time your grandfather didn't wake up with the sun?

### Lifestyle of programmers

More importantly, age is a good indicator of the relative lifestyles of programmers.

Few people have a family of their own at 22, while many or even most do when they are 40. This has a big effect on when people tend to do their coding because it means juggling different things around.

A lot of younger programmers work predominantly at night because they simply don't have the time to work during the day - there's classes to attend, schoolwork to finish, if they're very young simply doing the chores their parents give them is more important than any coding they might have going on.

So most of the coding happens at night - lovingly supported by their young person circadian rhythms.

Older programmers usually have a day job and are generally expected to put their programming on a higher priority. Since programming is suddenly the most important thing in their lives (after family and such), they tend to devote more time to this activity.

Coincidentally, there are many more day-time hours than there are night-time hours in most of the world. Plus there's a bunch of common wisdom going around that one is supposed to get work done during the day.

Especially if coding is your "day job", you might be expected to do it during the day.

### Pet projects

Which brings us to pet projects.

Programming is the sort of job you can only do if you really love it. It really is kind of addicting and most people I know simply can't let it go even outside their work hours.

Yes, there are many programmers who love programming as a day job and want to have other hobbies they can do in their off time and don't even want to look at code.

But even those have a pet project now and then. That little thing they do when nobody is looking, a tiny bunch of code that's done just for them. For the love of their work.

For play, if you will.

Play is very important in creative professions, even Feynman once said that he has gotten so bored with physics he's only going to devote himself to playing with the science again.

Having no obligations brings better work, solves more interesting challenges and refreshes the brain.

Few can do pet projects while at work. So they play with they sharpen the saw when nobody is looking - at night. During weekends and just generally _around_ their work work.

This leads even the most devoted staffer into working at night sometimes, adding fuel to the myth of programmers who convert caffeine into code.

## What about other creatives?

The title of this book is _Do programmers work at night?_. Your natural question might be something like "Do _only_ programmers work at night?"

Fair question, of course, and the answer is that not only programmers work at night, all creative professionals do.

In fact, I would go so far as saying that everyone working on creative things be they a writer, designer, artist or anything in between, deals with pretty much the same problems as programmers do.

But I can't write a book about everyone, my experience is in the programming world, they are the people I have easy access to and whom I can relate with. Everybody else is a mystery to me, I understand them only so far as they've talked to me on the internet and complained about not being included in the book.

Fear not, you will likely still find a lot of relevant information in this book anyway.
