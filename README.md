# Why programmers work at night

A popular saying goes that Programmers are machines that turn caffeine into code.

And sure enough, ask a random programmer when they do their best work and there’s a high chance they will admit to a lot of late nights. Some earlier, some later. A popular trend is to get up at 4am and get some work done before the day’s craziness begins. Others like going to bed at 4am.

But _why_?

## What is this, I don't even

I am writing a book about programmers and their work habits. Because I
believe in doing things out in the open, I am writing the book in a
public git repository where _you_ can help.

## How to help

* Read the book! [Link](https://leanpub.com/nightowls)
* Tell me about your habits -> swizec@swizec.com
* Report bugs
  * typos
  * missing reference
  * shoddy writing
  * something doesn't make sense
  * etc.
